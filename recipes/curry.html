        <h2>Description</h2>
            
            <p>Before I met my girlfriend, I didn't think I would enjoy curry because at the time I was a fairly picky eater. But we went to our first curry place in the summer of 2021, and I've loved curry ever since.</p>

            <p>Nowadays, curry is perhaps one of if not my favorite dish. My girlfriend makes it all the time, and although this is not her exact version of the recipe she uses, it is one that I'm sure if followed anyone will enjoy.</p>
