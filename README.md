This project will demonstrate basic capabilities to work with HTML along with basic Git workflow. 

HTML techniques involved include creating the boilerplate, working with text using elements and tags, creating lists, links, and images.

This project also helps to increase my familiarity with writing good commit messages through Git and GitHub.
